| R-05 | Create referral → Accept → Patient transferred | Referral flow |
| R-06 | Theme toggle persists | Settings |
| R-07 | Offline functionality | PWA/Service Worker |

## 7. Test Results Summary

### Data Flow Fixes Applied (2026-02-21)

| Issue | Before | After | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Consultation -> Lab orders | `labResults: []` always empty | Lab orders created in `taban_lab_results` DB | FIXED |
| Consultation -> Pharmacy | Prescriptions only in MedicalRecord | Prescriptions created in `taban_prescriptions` DB | FIXED |
| Pharmacy mock data | Hardcoded 6 prescriptions | Reads from PouchDB `taban_prescriptions` | FIXED |
| Diagnosis severity | Hardcoded `'moderate'` | Per-diagnosis severity selector (mild/moderate/severe) | FIXED |
| Prescription instructions | Always empty `''` | Instructions input field added | FIXED |
| Pharmacy dispense | Only updated local state | Persists to DB via `dispensePrescription()` | FIXED |
| Government patient count | Used `h.patientCount` (static) | Uses actual PouchDB patient count | FIXED (prior) |
| Referral patient transfer | Only status changed | Patient `registrationHospital` updated | FIXED (prior) |
| Boma visit patient creation | No patient record created | PatientDoc created for new patients | FIXED (prior) |

### Known Limitations

1. **Inventory management** - Still uses mock data (no inventory DB). Acceptable for MVP.
2. **Lab result → Medical record linking** - Lab results not back-linked to patient record when completed. Lab tech enters results but they don't auto-update the consultation's medical record.
3. **No idle session timeout** - Only 24h token expiry, no inactivity logout.
4. **PouchDB data not encrypted at rest** - IndexedDB contents visible in browser dev tools.
5. **Demo credentials visible** - Login page shows all demo accounts with passwords.

---

## 8. Risk-Based Test Priority

**Critical Path (Must Pass):**
1. Login works across all roles
2. Patient registration creates valid records
3. Doctor consultation saves to all 3 DBs (medical records, lab, prescriptions)
4. Lab tech can view and process orders from consultations
5. Pharmacist can view and dispense prescriptions from consultations
6. Referral acceptance transfers patient ownership

**High Priority:**
7. All sidebar navigation links work
8. Role-based access control blocks unauthorized pages
9. Dark/light theme toggle works
10. Data scoping filters by organization and hospital

**Medium Priority:**
11. AI clinical evaluation produces reasonable suggestions
12. Boma health worker visit recording
13. Government dashboard statistics accuracy
14. Search and filter functionality across all modules

---

## 9. Recommendations

1. **Add idle session timeout** (15-30 min) for HIPAA compliance
2. **Encrypt PouchDB at rest** using `crypto-pouch` plugin
3. **Remove demo credentials** from production login page or gate behind a flag
4. **Add CSRF tokens** for state-changing operations
5. **Link lab results back** to medical records when completed
6. **Build real inventory management** module with stock tracking
7. **Add unit tests** for critical services (auth, patient, lab, prescription)
8. **Add E2E tests** with Playwright or Cypress for the critical paths above
